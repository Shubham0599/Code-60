        5
       / \
      3   6
     / \
    2   4
Output:
Inorder of original tree: 2 3 4 5 6 
Inorder of mirror tree: 6 5 4 3 2
Mirror tree will be:
  5
 / \
6   3
   / \
  4   2

Input:
        2
       / \
      1   8
     /     \
    12      9
Output:
Inorder of original tree: 12 1 2 8 9 
Inorder of mirror tree: 9 8 2 1 12
